# Code Examples Execution
Each code example is stored in a folder with self-explanatory name, e.g., `extraction-class-names`, containing two files:

* The file that begins with the word `extraction` is the script that allows executing the code example. Simply launch the script using the Python interpreter, e.g., `python extraction_class_names.py`.
* The file that begins with `test` contains the source code processed when the script is executed. The latter finds the source code automatically, i.e., no script input parameters required.
